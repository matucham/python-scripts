# Disabling antiviruses for Windows Sandbox 
It is my simple project that introduced me to winreg, wmi and ctypes. It helps the users that want to disable Antivruses from system(sandbox) to test anything without them.
The code is for Windows system and it does not run when Windows Defender is turned on, so if you want to use the program the first step you need to do is to disable Windows Defender for the first time manually.
Defender(or any other AV) shouldn't work until you re-edit it manually in Windows Registry.
The code is harmless, because it only automates steps any user with appropriate privileges can do.
